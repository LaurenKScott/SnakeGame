Snake game in Java, demonstrating OOP, simple GUI, event listeners, machine states

### HOW TO PLAY

<p> The snake begins as a single pixel on a fixed-size, bounded board. A single-cell piece of food (static) is 
positioned randomly on the board. Score starts at zero. <br><br>
Control the snake with the <b> UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT </b> arrow keys, or with <b>W, A, S, D</b>
The snake must navigate to the piece of food, colliding with the food head-on in order to eat it.<br>
Each time the snake eats a piece of food,   
<li> the snake grows longer (one segment added to tail end) </li>
<li> a new piece of food is randomly placed </li>
<li> score increases by one </li>
<br>
The snake cannot stop. There is no pause button. If the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game board, 
<b>GAME OVER</b>
