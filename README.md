# SnakeGame
Snake game in Java

### HOW TO PLAY

<p> The player/snake begins as a single pixel on a fixed-size, bounded board. The snake has a head and a tail.<br>
A single-cell piece of food (static) is positioned randomly on the board. Score starts at zero.<br>
The snake navigates the board with the **UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT** arrow keys, or with **W, A, S, D**
The snake must navigate to the piece of food, colliding with the food head-on in order to eat it. <br>
Each time the snake eats a piece of food, the snake grows longer (one pixel added to tail end), 
and a new piece of food is randomly placed. Score increases by one. <br>
The snake cannot stop. There is no pause button.
If the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game board, **GAME OVER**<br>
